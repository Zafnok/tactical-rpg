//! Controllers (ticket 0219, ADR-0034): reads every connected pad's raw
//! state each frame, with gilrs on native and the browser's Gamepad API
//! (through `web/gamepad.js`) on web, and hands it to `trpg-ui`'s [`Pads`],
//! which holds all the rules (sticks as directions, the Switch-style swap,
//! several pads as one). Like `keys.rs`, this only translates.
